# Portfolio

## [Live Demo](https://kynhix.dev)

## About
This is my portfolio website. I wanted to make it as minimal as possible with no super fancy libraries or framworks. I really love Tailwind, so I added it to the project and Vite as a test server. Anyone is free to use this code, but if you do, make sure to give it a star.

## Installation

Clone repo and go into the newly created directory
```
git clone portfolio
cd portfolio
```
Run npm install
```
npm install
```
Thats it.

## Test server
To run the vite test server, simply run ``npm run dev -- --open`` and it will automatically open it up in a new window.

### Note 
In order to get Tailwind to work properly, you need to open up a new terminal and run ``npm watch``

## Building

Simply run
```
npm run build
```
Vite will build the project and Tailwind will minify the root.css file. The output folder is defaulted to dist.
